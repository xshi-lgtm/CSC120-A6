1. Added Javadoc to `ShopTest` and normalized brace spacing to keep `{` on the same line as method signatures.
2. Replaced the direct-field-write test with `test_fields_should_be_private` to flag missing encapsulation.
3. Updated `bugLog.md` Bug #4 entry to document the encapsulation bug instead of the duplicate toString price issue.
