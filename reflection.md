What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

At first I got stuck because I didn’t enable the test environment correctly so none of my tests were running I spent a long time trying to figure out why until I asked the TA and realized I needed to set up JUnit properly After that things went smoother but the format was still easy to mess up and sometimes one missing bracket would stop everything I also struggled to find all ten bugs at first because some of them were not obvious like the wrong string comparison or the loop using <= My advice for future students is to make sure everything is installed early in the semester and double check the setup before starting Writing tests actually made me slow down and think about what the program was really supposed to do It was a bit tiring but it helped me understand the logic more deeply and notice details I would have totally missed before。
